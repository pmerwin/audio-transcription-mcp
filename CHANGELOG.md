## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- üéâ **NPM Package Support** - Now available on npm! Use with `npx audio-transcription-mcp`
- **Complete Session Isolation** - Each transcript session gets a unique timestamped filename (format: `transcript_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS-mmm.md`)
- **Session Management** - All MCP endpoints now respect session uniqueness (start, stop, status, get, clear, cleanup)
- **Privacy Guarantees** - Zero chance of transcript bleeding between sessions
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 61 passing tests covering all MCP endpoints and session isolation
- Added `generateTimestampedFilename()` utility function with millisecond precision
- Added `prepublishOnly` script to ensure build and tests run before publishing
- New test files: `mcp-endpoints.test.ts`, `session-isolation.test.ts`, `utils.test.ts`

### Changed
- **Breaking Change**: Default transcript filename is now auto-generated with timestamp instead of fixed `meeting_transcript.md`
- Updated MCP server to use session-based file tracking instead of global state
- Improved `cleanup_transcript` endpoint to require active session and clear session reference after deletion
- Updated documentation with npx usage instructions (MCP_SETUP.md, README.md)

### Fixed
- Fixed transcript bleeding between sessions - now each session is completely isolated
- Fixed concurrent session prevention logic
- All MCP endpoints now correctly reference the active session's transcript file

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- Fixed transcript bleeding issue where new transcription sessions would append to previous transcripts instead of starting fresh
- Now always clears and reinitializes transcript file when starting a new session

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- üéâ **Claude Desktop Filesystem Support** - Added `OUTFILE_DIR` environment variable to specify output directory for transcripts
- **File System Permissions** - Support for Claude Desktop's `allowedDirectories` security model
- **Documentation** - New `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md` with step-by-step setup guide
- **Example Configs** - Added `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG_EXAMPLE.json` with working configuration
- **Enhanced Documentation** - Updated all guides (MCP_SETUP.md, README.md, env.example) with Claude Desktop requirements

### Changed
- File path handling now uses `join(OUTFILE_DIR, filename)` for better control over output location
- Updated resource reading to support both absolute and relative paths
- Improved error messages for filesystem permission issues

### Fixed
- **Claude Desktop "read-only file system" error** - Fixed by adding proper filesystem access configuration
- File path resolution now works correctly in both Cursor and Claude Desktop environments

### Technical Details
- Default `OUTFILE_DIR` is `process.cwd()` for backward compatibility with Cursor
- All 61 tests continue to pass
- Zero breaking changes - existing Cursor configurations work unchanged
- Clean separation between Cursor (broader permissions) and Claude Desktop (explicit permissions)

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- **Debug Logging** - Added comprehensive debug output to help troubleshoot Claude Desktop issues
  - Version number logged on startup
  - Current working directory
  - OUTFILE_DIR value
  - Output file paths when starting transcription
- All debug info sent to stderr to not interfere with MCP protocol

### Purpose
- This is a debug release to help identify Claude Desktop caching and filesystem issues
- Helps verify which version is actually running
- Helps diagnose OUTFILE_DIR configuration problems

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Debug logging now writes to file (`~/.audio-transcription-mcp-debug.log`) instead of stderr
- Previous version's console.error() was corrupting MCP JSON-RPC protocol messages
- Claude Desktop can now properly communicate with the server

### Changed
- Debug output moved from stderr to `~/.audio-transcription-mcp-debug.log`
- MCP protocol communication no longer interrupted by debug messages

## [0.3.3] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Fixed "File is not defined" error by using `toFile` from openai SDK instead of browser File API
- **CRITICAL:** Removed ALL console.log/console.error calls that were corrupting MCP JSON-RPC protocol
- All logging now goes to `~/.audio-transcription-mcp-debug.log` instead of stdout/stderr
- Fixed transcription-session.ts, audio-capturer.ts console outputs

### Changed
- Transcription service now properly uses OpenAI SDK's toFile helper for Node.js compatibility
- All runtime logging redirected to debug log file to prevent MCP protocol corruption

### Technical Details
- The MCP protocol uses stdio (stdin/stdout) for JSON-RPC communication
- ANY output to stdout or stderr corrupts the protocol messages
- All console statements now use debugLog() function writing to ~/.audio-transcription-mcp-debug.log

## [0.3.4] - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Removed `process.stdout.write()` that was writing transcript text to stdout
- This was the final source of JSON corruption in MCP protocol
- Transcript output with markdown formatting (e.g., `**2025-10-03**`) was corrupting JSON-RPC messages
- Transcripts are still saved to file, but no longer output to stdout in MCP mode

### Changed
- Transcript text now logged to debug file instead of stdout
- MCP protocol should now work without any JSON parsing errors

## [0.3.5] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Debug log now automatically clears on server startup for fresh session logs
- Easier debugging with clean log file each time MCP server starts

### Changed
- Version number updated to 0.3.4 in debug output (was hardcoded to 0.3.1)

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- üéØ **Status Change Notifications** - Real-time event system for MCP clients
  - Emits events for: started, stopped, paused, resumed, silence_detected, audio_detected
  - All events logged to debug file with emoji markers for easy tracking
  - Callback-based system allows MCP clients to be notified immediately of status changes
  
- üí∞ **OpenAI Cost Guard & Tracking** - Explicit protection against sending silence to API
  - New `silentChunksSkipped` status field tracks chunks NOT sent to OpenAI
  - Debug logging shows cost savings in real-time ($0.006 per minute avoided)
  - Double-guard system ensures 100% that silent audio never reaches Whisper API
  - Explicit documentation and tests verify API protection

- üìä **Enhanced Status Reporting**
  - Added `silentChunksSkipped` field to track cost savings
  - Improved debug logging with emoji markers (üé§ üîá üéµ ‚è∏Ô∏è ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ‚èπÔ∏è üí∞)
  - Better visibility into what audio is/isn't being sent to OpenAI

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `TranscriptionSession` constructor now accepts optional `StatusChangeCallback`
- Enhanced debug logging for all state transitions
- More explicit comments around OpenAI API guard logic

### Tests
- Added 15 new comprehensive tests (93 ‚Üí 108 total tests)

  - Enhanced `resume_transcription` MCP tool (works for both manual and auto-pause)
  - Supports workflow: start ‚Üí pause ‚Üí resume ‚Üí stop
  - Audio capture continues during pause but transcription stops (saves API costs)
  
- üîá **Automatic Silence Detection** - Smart audio monitoring
  - Detects when no audio is being captured (4 consecutive silent chunks)
  - Automatically pauses transcription when silence is detected
  - Auto-resumes when audio is detected (for silence pauses only)
  - Manual pauses require explicit resume command
  - Configurable silence threshold (default: amplitude < 100)
