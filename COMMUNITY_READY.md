Title: [Release] Audio Transcription MCP Server - Real-time transcription for Cursor & Claude Desktop

Body:
I've built an MCP server that brings real-time audio transcription to Cursor and Claude Desktop using OpenAI's Whisper API.

**Features:**
- üéôÔ∏è Real-time system audio capture (macOS)
- üìù Timestamped markdown transcripts
- üîí Complete session isolation for privacy
- ‚úÖ 61 passing tests, zero vulnerabilities
- üöÄ Works with npx (no installation!)

**Quick Start:**
Just add to your MCP config and restart:
```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "audio-transcription-mcp"],
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-key",
    "INPUT_DEVICE_NAME": "BlackHole"
  }
}
```

npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/audio-transcription-mcp

Feedback welcome!

#### Hacker News (Show HN)

Title: Show HN: Audio Transcription MCP Server for Cursor and Claude Desktop

Text:
I built an MCP server that adds real-time audio transcription to Cursor and Claude Desktop using OpenAI Whisper.

It captures system audio (via BlackHole on macOS), transcribes it in configurable chunks, and saves timestamped markdown transcripts. Each session gets a unique file for privacy.

The interesting technical challenge was avoiding stdout/stderr contamination - MCP uses stdio for JSON-RPC, so any console output corrupts the protocol. We route all logging to a debug file instead.

Installation is just `npx audio-transcription-mcp` - no npm install needed. It's well-tested (61 tests) and works in production.

Happy to answer questions about building MCP servers or the implementation!
